"""#263 audit: how many _code_ident values on real history are reachable from
more than one distinct (entity_type, file_path, name) input?

_canonical_ident (mcp_server.py:4090) maps every character outside [a-z0-9-]
to a hyphen and then collapses runs of hyphens. _code_ident builds its input as
f"{file_path}::{name}", so the separator and a leading underscore in the name
both become hyphens and the collapse merges them:

    tests/test_mcp_server.py::_commit -> tests-test-mcp-server-py-commit
    tests/test_mcp_server.py::commit  -> tests-test-mcp-server-py-commit

WHY THIS AUDIT IS SOURCE-DERIVED AND NOT GRAPH-DERIVED. When two entities
collide, the second one parsed takes _build_code_triples' `ident in
entity_valid_from` branch, which appends a :modified-in triple and NOTHING
else -- no :entity-type, no :ident, no :description, no :file. The graph
therefore holds no record of the losing entity's (file_path, name) pair at
all, and widening #257's census key from :description to (:file, :description)
does not recover it. The three collisions #257 found were visible only because
those entities were closed and reopened, which re-runs the introduction branch.
Any graph-side count is a bound; only the inputs give an exact one.

READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION. This module opens no MiniGrafDb handle, writes no
facts, and never mutates mcp_server. The candidate rules below are standalone
pure functions, deliberately NOT monkeypatches of _canonical_ident -- an audit
must not mutate the module it measures.
